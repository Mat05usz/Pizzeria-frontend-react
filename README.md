# Pizzeria-frontend-react

## About
Frontend created for an imaginary Pizzeria using React, typescript and SCSS. Most of the website is created as a Single Page Application, with an additional route
to a product page where a user can see more details about a menu item they would like to order.

## Work in progress
Currently about 50% of planned content is in. Most of the design is done (altough it will probably be changed since I'm not really content with how the site 
looks like) as well as a 'skeleton' for the content. It's already mostly responsive so should look fine on mobile devices.

## Running the app
Navigate to the main project folder and type `npm run start`.
