# Pizzeria-frontend-react

## About
Frontend created for an imaginary Pizzeria using React, typescript and SCSS. Most of the website is created as a Single Page Application, with an additional route
to a product page where a user can see more details about a menu item they would like to order.

## Work in progress
Currently about 50% of planned content is in. Most of the design is done (altough it will probably be changed since I'm not really content with how the site 
looks like) as well as a 'skeleton' for the content. It's already mostly responsive so should look fine on mobile devices.

## Live

Live currently not working due to Heroku removing OAuth with Github, making it impossible to update the production branch from github (and frankly, since I've wanted to switch hosting anyways for quite some time now, I won't be dealing with Heroku CLI to deploy).
